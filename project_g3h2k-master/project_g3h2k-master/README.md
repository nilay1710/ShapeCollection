# My Personal Project

## PlayWithShapes


- What will the application do?
This application takes in shapes from the user and stores them as a Collection. Then, various methods can be performed 
on 
this list of shapes. The methods could be sorting, finding sum of interior angles, finding the largest shape,
 and
 so on.
 
- Who will use it? ***Anyone*** can use it. It will be used to perform 
functions on any list of shapes. 

- Why is this project of interest to me? It is of interest to me because any number of methods can be designed to 
work on a list of shapes, so the possibilities are endless.







## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new shape to the Collection.

- As a user, I want to be able to count the number of shapes in my Collection.

- As a user, I want to be able to change the angle of the collection.

- As a user, I want to be able to check if a shape exists in my collection

- As a user, I want to be able to display all my shapes

- As a user, I want to be able to save my shape collection to file

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my Shape collection from file

## Phase 4: Task 2

- I made the Shape class more robust by adding an exception in the constructor for this class

## Phase 4: Task 3

- If i had more time, i would combine the functioning of the shape gui and shape collection app in order to reduce 
coupling.

- There are some parts of the code in ShapeGui that keep repeating, like creating a JFrame, so I would refactor that to 
make a method for creating a JFrame to make it earier to read and reduce duplication
