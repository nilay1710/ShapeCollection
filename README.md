This project takes in the shape length and number of sides and displays a regular shape on the screen, and saves the data to a JSON file
Used abstract Java Classes to store shapes and a GUI to display the shapes and take user inputs.
Learned the importance of organizing code and testing it thoroughly, and also about managing data effectively using Json files
